Idea 1
An improved Note taking solution 

Problem - Note taking and memorization is very tedious. 
Taking notes in class, rewrite those notes in more detail after class, 
Make flash cards for notes, create a vocab sheet, color code notes, 

- This causes us to rewrite our notes too often or neglect them all 
together

Solution - Using Psuedo-code, everyone can take notes once and 
have the notes automatically filter in to new pages based on the page
types

Example:
Pointer: this variable stores the memory address of another variable
Code: int *food = &pizza;
Why is this useful, we can use this to dynamically allocate resources

our app would do this:

[Vocabulary] Pointer ;(semi-colon is the delimiter) 
  this variable stores the memory address of another variable

then users can goto Vocabulary.txt and all Vocabulary they marked 
the definition.

Alternatively, users could create a brain_storm.txt
and create another sheet called [Coding_Ideas]. Then users can rewrite 
the following: [Coding_Ideas] A project about penguins; code app for 
talking penguins. 

Then Coding_Ideas.txt would have all of these ideas, organizing it for
them. Also these values would be pass by values, then users can edit 
definitions in any .txt file to see the live changes

Idea 2
Community Art app

An app that simplifies Community outreach for emerging artists

Problem: Artists have difficulty getting their work noticed

Solution: Create an app that allows artists to sell work, talk with 
potential art buyers, and promote their work all in one place
